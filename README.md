Experimental dynamic 2D global illumination system for Bevy, based on SDF ray-marching and screen space irradiance cache probes.

## Demo

```shell
cargo run --example minimal
cargo run --example krypta
cargo run --example movement
```

![Bevy Magic Light 2D – Demo](https://github.com/zaycev/bevy-magic-light-2d/blob/main/static/demo.gif?raw=true)

Implementation is based on several approaches:

- First pass computes SDF for all occluders and stores it in a texture with one channel.
- Second pass computes irradiance from direct light. We check amount of light received by probe taking into account occlusion which checked using SDF. The final contribution for each light source is computed using square falloff.
- Third pass computes secondary bounced light. The approach is similar to the second pass, but instead of direct light, it uses irradiance is sampled from the probes. We use exponential sampling to check how much of reflected light is received by probe. Same as in the second pass SDF is used to check occlusion and the final contribution is computed using square falloff.
- Finally, we combine results from the second and third passes combining cache from the previous eight frames. The we optionally filter the result using a edge-aware smoothing filter and apply Gamma correction.

The main performance gain is coming from computing value of only 1 / 64 number of pixels (for 8x8 probe size). The rest of the pixels are interpolated from the nearest probes.

### Usage

```shell
cargo run --example krypta
```

- WASD to control camera.
- SHIFT+LMC to place a light source.
- RMC to change color of light source.

## Recent Improvements

### GPU Buffer Binding Robustness (Bevy 0.17.2)

**Problem Solved**: Eliminated confusing startup warning messages:
- `"Some GPU buffers are not bound - skipping bind group creation"`
- `"Failed to get bind groups"`

**Root Cause**: In Bevy's render pipeline, GPU resources may not be immediately available during the first few frames due to asynchronous resource loading. The original code would log warnings during normal startup, which was confusing for users.

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Comprehensive resource validation**: Added `are_buffers_ready()` function that validates all storage/uniform buffers and texture targets before proceeding
- ✅ **Graceful startup handling**: Early returns when resources aren't ready (normal during initialization)
- ✅ **Improved logging**: Changed from warning-level to debug-level logging to avoid console spam
- ✅ **Safe resource access**: All unwrap() calls are now guarded by prior validation
- ✅ **Render node robustness**: Enhanced `LightPass2DNode` to handle missing resources gracefully

**Benefits**:
- 🚫 No more warning spams during application startup
- 🛡️ Robust error handling with specific debug messages  
- ⚡ Faster initialization with fewer unnecessary warning checks
- 🔧 Better developer experience with clear error information
